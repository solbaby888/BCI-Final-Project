function [predicted_dg] = make_predictions(test_ecog)

% Inputs: test_ecog - 3 x 1 cell array containing ECoG for each subject, where test_ecog{i} 
% to the ECoG for subject i. Each cell element contains a N x M testing ECoG,
% where N is the number of samples and M is the number of EEG channels.
% Outputs: predicted_dg - 3 x 1 cell array, where predicted_dg{i} contains the 
% data_glove prediction for subject i, which is an N x 5 matrix (for
% fingers 1:5)

% Run time: The script has to run less than 1 hour.
